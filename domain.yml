  - Details about professors of IIT Bbsr  \n
  - Class timetable  \n
  - IITBBS transport schedule  \n
  - upcoming events in the campus  \n
  - Live scores  \n
  - Best places around the campus \n
  - Weather \n \n
  What all can he do for you? \n

  How to talk to him? \n
  Just ask him a question like- How is the weather today? or
  maybe ask him to send an email- I want to mail someone.
  You can also have a small chitchat with him when you are sad
  just tell him what you feel."
